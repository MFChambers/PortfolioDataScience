The state with the most names was California with 66 babies that shared my name. This accounts for nearly 18% of the national total. I was born in Arizona, which had 8 babies born in 1999 named Maia, making it more meaninful to me to see my name reflected in the data from my birth year and state. Looking at the chart I created, the data suggests that while Maia wasn't a top national name, it has been steadily adopted across a variety of coast, particularly in the coasts and in urbanized regions. The black line in the chart represents the underlying trend over time, a steady increase in popularity starting around the late 1990s and continuing past 2010. I expect that it will remain at this steady rate unless an outside source influences our society (Ex: popculture, movies, books, etc.).\n"
